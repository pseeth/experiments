  * [`launch-services`](./launch-services.sh). **TODO**: describe `launch-services` stage.

# Obtaining the pipeline

To add this pipeline to your project using the
[`popper` CLI tool](https://github.com/systemslab/popper):

```bash
cd your-repo
popper add pseeth/experiments/create-virtual-environment
```

# Running the pipeline

To run the pipeline using the
[`popper` CLI tool](https://github.com/systemslab/popper):

```bash
cd experiments
popper run create-virtual-environment
```

The pipeline is executed on the following environment(s): `host`. In addition,
the following environment variables are expected:

  * `<ENV_VAR1>`. Description of variable.
  * `<ENV_VAR2>`. Another description.

For example, the following is an execution with all expected
variables:

```bash
export <ENV_VAR1>=value-for-<ENV_VAR_1>
export <ENV_VAR2>=value-for-<ENV_VAR_2>

popper run create-virtual-environment
```

> **TODO**: rename or remove `export` statements above appropriately.
